ðŸš€ Overview

- QA/PO writes the `.feature` file (Gherkin syntax)
- AI reads the feature file and generates test code
- Developer runs the tests (initially failing)
- Developer implements the code to make tests pass
- Developer reruns the tests until all pass âœ…

ðŸ§© Tech Stack

- Next.js (TypeScript) â€“ Frontend framework
- Jest â€“ Unit testing framework
- Jest-Cucumber â€“ BDD test runner
- OpenAI API â€“ Test case generator
- dotenv â€“ Manage API keys and environment variables
- fs / path â€“ File system utilities for reading/writing test files

ðŸ’¡ How It Works

- The generate-tests.ts script reads all .feature files in src/__tests__/features/.
- It sends the content to the OpenAI API, asking for clean, runnable test files.
- AI returns two separate test implementations:
   One for BDD (jest-cucumber)
   One for unit testing (Jest)
- The files are written automatically into src/__tests__/generated.
